Absolutely! Let's walk through each of the three Fibonacci implementations and compare them in terms of **logic**, **efficiency**, and **practical usage**.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Recursive Fibonacci**

```js
var fib = function (n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) return n;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
};
```

### üîç How it works:

- This is the most straightforward and intuitive approach.
- It directly follows the definition: `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`.

### üß† Example (n = 5):

```
fib(5) = fib(4) + fib(3)
       = (fib(3) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))
       = ...
```

### ‚ùå Problems:

- **Time Complexity: O(2^n)** ‚Üí exponential!
- **Space Complexity: O(n)** due to call stack.
- Extremely inefficient for large `n` because it recalculates the same values many times (no memoization).

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Iterative Fibonacci using `temp`**

```js
var fib = function (n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
  let n1 = 0,
    n2 = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    let temp = n2;
    n2 = n1 + temp;
    n1 = temp;
  }
  return n2;
};
```

### üîç How it works:

- Uses a loop to calculate Fibonacci values from the bottom up.
- `n1` holds fib(i - 2), `n2` holds fib(i - 1)
- Updates them in each iteration.

### ‚úÖ Advantages:

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**
- **Space Complexity: O(1)** ‚Üí no recursion, constant space.
- Very efficient and readable.

## ‚úÖ 3. **Iterative Fibonacci using destructuring**

```js
var fib = function (n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
  let n1 = 0,
    n2 = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    [n1, n2] = [n2, n1 + n2];
  }
  return n2;
};
```

### üîç How it works:

- Same logic as the second version, but uses array destructuring to swap values in one line.

### ‚úÖ Pros:

- **Same time and space complexity** as version 2.
- More concise and elegant.

### ‚ùó Potential downside:

- Slightly less performant in tight loops (due to array creation), but very minor difference.

## üîö Summary Table:

| Version              | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Readability | Performance        |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Recursive            | ‚ùå O(2^n)       | ‚ùå O(n)          | ‚úÖ Easy     | ‚ùå Very slow       |
| Iterative (`temp`)   | ‚úÖ O(n)         | ‚úÖ O(1)          | ‚úÖ Clear    | ‚úÖ Fast            |
| Iterative (destruct) | ‚úÖ O(n)         | ‚úÖ O(1)          | ‚úÖ Elegant  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly slower |

---

### üèÜ **Best Choice?**

For **most real-world cases**, use the **iterative with temp** version:

```js
var fib = function (n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
  let n1 = 0,
    n2 = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    let temp = n2;
    n2 = n1 + temp;
    n1 = temp;
  }
  return n2;
};
```

It‚Äôs fast, clear, and doesn't rely on recursion.

Would you like to see how to write a **memoized** version of the recursive one to make it efficient too?
