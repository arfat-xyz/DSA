# 🔥 Full Explanation of Your `countOdds` Function:

## 1. `countOddsUsingForLoop(newLow, newHigh)`

### ➡️ How It Works:

- If `newLow` is even, make it odd by doing `newLow++`.
- If `newHigh` is even, make it odd by doing `newHigh--`.
- Then, starting from `newLow`, **add +2** every step (because odds are 2 apart: 1, 3, 5, 7, etc).
- Store each odd in an array `allOdds`.
- Finally, **return `allOdds.length`** (the number of odds found).

### 📈 Time Complexity:

- **O(n/2)** → **O(n)** in Big-O notation, because you're looping over half the numbers between `low` and `high`.

### 🧠 Space Complexity:

- **O(n/2)** → **O(n)**, because you're **storing** all the odd numbers inside `allOdds` array.

### ✅ Benefits:

- Very **easy to understand** for beginners.
- Actually **collects the odd numbers** if you need them later.

### ❌ Downsides:

- **Memory heavy** (storing all odd numbers unnecessarily).
- **Slow** for big ranges (e.g., `low=1`, `high=99342399` will create a **huge** array! 🐢).

## 2. `countOddUsingMath(newLow, newHigh)`

### ➡️ How It Works:

- Checks whether `newLow` and `newHigh` are:
  - **Both even**, **both odd**, or **one even and one odd**.
- Then, applies a **simple formula**:

| Case                  | Formula                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| both even or both odd | `(newHigh - newLow) / 2 + (newHigh % 2)` |
| one even and one odd  | `(newHigh - newLow + 1) / 2`             |

### 📈 Time Complexity:

- **O(1)** → Constant time. ✅  
  (Just a few arithmetic operations.)

### 🧠 Space Complexity:

- **O(1)** → No arrays, no loops, no extra memory. ✅

### ✅ Benefits:

- **Very fast**, even for huge input ranges.
- **Uses almost no memory**.
- **Perfectly scalable** for any input size.

### ❌ Downsides:

- Slightly **harder to understand** at first if you're new to modulo operations.

# 🎯 Conclusion:

✅ Use `countOddUsingMath` for **real-world use**, **interviews**, and **production code**.

✅ Use `countOddsUsingForLoop` **only for teaching** beginners how loops work, or if you specifically need the actual list of odd numbers.

---

# 📦 Tiny Note (Optional Improvement):

You could even _simplify_ the `countOddUsingMath` into one line:

```javascript
const countOddUsingMath = (low, high) =>
  Math.floor((high + 1) / 2) - Math.floor(low / 2);
```

**Explanation**:

- `(high + 1) / 2` counts how many odds from `0` to `high`.
- `low / 2` counts how many odds below `low`.
- Their difference gives odds in `[low, high]` inclusive.

✅ Even faster and cleaner!
